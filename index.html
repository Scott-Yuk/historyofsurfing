  <p>The riding of waves has likely existed since humans began swimming in the ocean. In this sense,
    bodysurfing is the oldest type of wave-catching. Archaeological evidence suggests that ancient
    cultures of Peru surfed on reed watercraft for fishing and recreation up to five thousand years
    ago. Standing up on what is now called a surfboard is a relatively recent innovation developed by the Polynesians.
    The influences for modern surfing can be directly traced to the surfers of pre-contact Hawaii.</p>
